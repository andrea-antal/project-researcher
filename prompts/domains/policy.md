# Domain: Political Theory & Economic Policy

## Source Trust Hierarchy

**Tier 1 - Primary Sources (Highest Trust)**
- Legislative text, bills, statutes, regulations
- Court decisions and legal opinions
- Official government reports and statistics (BLS, CBO, Fed, Census)
- Central bank publications and monetary policy statements
- Treaty texts and international agreements
- Academic peer-reviewed research in established journals
- Original theoretical works by foundational thinkers

**Tier 2 - Verified Secondary Sources (High Trust)**
- Major think tanks with disclosed methodology and funding:
  - Note ideological lean but don't dismiss: Brookings (center-left), AEI (center-right), RAND (nonpartisan), Cato (libertarian), etc.
  - Look for: transparent methodology, data sources cited, author credentials
- Academic institutions and university research centers
- Established journalism with fact-checking standards (note editorial lean)
- Congressional Research Service reports
- IMF, World Bank, OECD publications

**Tier 3 - Analytical Sources (Moderate Trust - Note Perspective)**
- Policy analysis from advocacy organizations (understand their position)
- Op-eds from credentialed authors (valuable for arguments, not facts)
- Political magazines with clear editorial stance
- Expert testimony and congressional hearings
- Historical analysis and case studies

**Tier 4 - Use With Caution**
- Partisan media without fact-checking standards
- Anonymous policy blogs
- Social media takes (even from experts - less rigorous)
- Outdated analysis (policy context changes)
- Advocacy pieces disguised as neutral analysis

## Domain-Specific Evaluation

### Currency Considerations
- Foundational theory: Age matters less (Hayek, Keynes, Rawls still relevant)
- Current policy debates: Recent data and context matters
- Historical analysis: Older sources valuable for understanding evolution
- Statistics: Use most recent available data

### Ideological Mapping
- Identify where sources sit on political spectrum
- Seek sources from multiple perspectives on contested issues
- Note when a conclusion comes from an unexpected ideological source (higher signal)
- Distinguish empirical claims from value judgments

### Evidence Quality
- Strongest: Randomized controlled trials, natural experiments
- Strong: Large-n quantitative studies, rigorous case comparisons
- Moderate: Case studies, historical analysis, theoretical arguments
- Weak: Anecdotes, cherry-picked examples, correlation-as-causation

### Steelmanning
- Present the strongest version of each position
- Identify the real cruxes of disagreement (empirical vs. values-based)
- Note where reasonable people disagree and why

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

When researching policy topics, consider asking about:
- Scope: Specific policy mechanism vs. broad theoretical framework
- Context: Particular country/region or general principles
- Timeframe: Historical analysis vs. current debate vs. future proposals
- Perspective: Neutral overview vs. evaluating specific positions
- Depth: Quick summary of positions vs. deep dive into evidence
