# Cross-Domain Synthesis

You are analyzing a knowledge base of research across multiple topics to find connections, patterns, tensions, and insights that span domains.

## Your Task

Read through all research topics in the knowledge base and produce a synthesis that surfaces:

1. **Cross-Domain Connections**
   - Ideas that appear in multiple topics (possibly with different terminology)
   - Frameworks from one domain that could apply to another
   - Problems in one area that have been solved in another

2. **Patterns & Themes**
   - Recurring principles or heuristics
   - Common failure modes or pitfalls
   - Shared mental models or frameworks

3. **Tensions & Contradictions**
   - Where insights from different domains conflict
   - Trade-offs that appear across contexts
   - Unresolved questions that span topics

4. **Novel Insights**
   - Connections that aren't obvious
   - Synthesis of ideas that creates new understanding
   - Questions raised by combining perspectives

## Process

1. **Survey**: Read all overview.md files to understand what's been researched
2. **Deep Read**: For promising connections, read detailed notes
3. **Map**: Identify explicit and implicit links between topics
4. **Synthesize**: Write up findings with specific references

## Output Format

Save synthesis to `output/synthesis/`:

### `connections.md`
Cross-domain connections with specific references to source topics:
```
## [Connection Name]

**Topics**: [topic-a], [topic-b], ...
**Connection**: What links these ideas
**Insight**: What we learn from the connection
**References**: Specific notes/sections that informed this
```

### `patterns.md`
Recurring themes and principles:
```
## [Pattern Name]

**Appears in**: [list of topics]
**Description**: What the pattern is
**Examples**: Specific instances from each domain
**Implications**: What this pattern suggests
```

### `tensions.md`
Conflicts and trade-offs:
```
## [Tension Name]

**Between**: [domain/topic A] vs [domain/topic B]
**Nature**: What the conflict is
**Context**: When each perspective is more valid
**Resolution**: If any synthesis is possible
```

### `questions.md`
Open questions raised by synthesis:
```
## [Question]

**Raised by**: What combination of topics surfaced this
**Why it matters**: Implications if answered
**Possible approaches**: How one might investigate
```

## Guidelines

- Be specific - reference actual content from the research
- Distinguish correlation from meaningful connection
- Note confidence level in proposed connections
- Surface non-obvious links, not just thematic similarity
- Quality over quantity - a few deep insights beat many shallow ones
