# Domain: Thought Leadership

This domain focuses on finding and vetting leading thinkers on a topic - people whose ideas shape their field. The goal is to identify who is worth listening to and synthesize their key contributions.

## Finding Leading Thinkers

When researching a topic, identify potential thought leaders through:

1. **Citation and Reference Patterns**
   - Who do other experts cite when discussing this topic?
   - Whose frameworks or terminology has become standard?
   - Who gets invited to speak at top venues?

2. **Contribution Mapping**
   - Who originated key ideas vs. who popularizes them?
   - Who has built/created/proven vs. who comments?
   - Who has skin in the game?

3. **Cross-Domain Recognition**
   - Are they respected by peers in adjacent fields?
   - Do serious people engage with their work?

## Authority Vetting Framework

### Positive Signals (Weighted Together)

**Track Record & Credentials**
- Depth of experience in the domain (years, roles, accomplishments)
- Academic credentials relevant to the topic (not just prestigious degrees)
- Built, created, or proven something substantial
- Publications in peer-reviewed venues or equivalent rigor

**Peer Recognition**
- Cited by other domain experts (not just popular with general audience)
- Invited to serious venues (not just podcast circuit)
- Engages in substantive dialogue with critics
- Respected by people who disagree with them

**Predictive Accuracy** (for those making claims about the future)
- Have past predictions held up?
- Do they acknowledge and learn from misses?
- Calibrated confidence (uncertain when appropriate)

**Quality of Reasoning**
- Steelmans counterarguments
- Acknowledges limitations and uncertainty
- Shows their work - transparent about methodology
- Updates views when evidence changes
- Engages with strongest critiques, not just weak ones

**Independence**
- Not just following consensus for safety
- Not just being contrarian for attention
- Willing to hold unpopular positions with good reasoning

### Red Flags

**Authority Inflation**
- Expertise in one domain claimed in another
- Credentials impressive but not relevant to topic
- Title/position substituted for actual contribution

**Popularity Without Substance**
- Large audience but not respected by peers
- Famous for being famous
- Optimized for engagement over insight

**Reasoning Quality Issues**
- Never wrong, never uncertain
- Dismisses critics rather than engaging
- Hot takes without substantive backing
- Straw-mans opposing views
- Unfalsifiable claims

**Incentive Problems**
- Financial interest in conclusions
- Building brand rather than seeking truth
- Audience capture (tells followers what they want to hear)

## Source Trust Hierarchy

**Tier 1 - Primary Works**
- Books, papers, essays by the thinkers themselves
- Long-form interviews where they develop ideas fully
- Lectures and talks with substantive content

**Tier 2 - Serious Engagement**
- Critical reviews by other domain experts
- Academic analysis of their contributions
- Substantive debates with qualified interlocutors

**Tier 3 - Context & Summary**
- Profiles in reputable publications
- Podcast appearances (good for accessibility, less rigorous)
- Summary articles about their work

**Tier 4 - Use With Caution**
- Social media presence (less filtered, more reactive)
- Promotional interviews
- Hagiographic profiles

## Output Format for Thought Leadership Research

Structure findings as:
- **Key Figures**: Who are the leading voices and why
- **Authority Assessment**: For each figure, note credentials, track record, peer recognition
- **Core Ideas**: What are their main contributions
- **Points of Disagreement**: Where do experts differ
- **Lineage**: Who influenced whom, how ideas evolved
- **Recommended Reading**: Best entry points to their work

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

When researching thought leadership topics, consider asking about:
- Specific aspect of the field they're interested in
- Whether they want established figures or emerging voices
- Academic vs. practitioner vs. public intellectual perspectives
- Particular schools of thought or approaches to include
- Depth: Survey of landscape vs. deep dive on key figures
