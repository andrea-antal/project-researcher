# Domain: General

This is the fallback domain for topics that don't clearly fit tech, policy, or thought leadership categories.

## Source Trust Hierarchy

**Tier 1 - Primary Sources (Highest Trust)**
- Original research, data, and official publications
- Direct documentation from authoritative bodies
- Peer-reviewed academic work
- Primary source documents

**Tier 2 - Verified Secondary Sources (High Trust)**
- Established publications with editorial standards
- Expert analysis from credentialed authors
- Reputable news organizations with fact-checking
- Academic and research institutions

**Tier 3 - Community & Practitioner Sources (Moderate Trust)**
- Practitioner blogs and writeups with clear authorship
- Forum discussions from knowledgeable communities
- Book reviews and summaries from credible sources
- Educational content from established platforms

**Tier 4 - Use With Caution**
- Content farms and aggregator sites
- Anonymous or unattributed content
- Promotional material disguised as information
- Outdated content (relevance depends on topic)

## Domain-Specific Evaluation

### Adapt to Topic
- Scientific topics: Prioritize peer review, replication, methodology
- Historical topics: Primary sources, academic consensus, multiple perspectives
- Practical/how-to: Real experience, tested approaches, clear results
- Current events: Multiple news sources, fact-checking, primary documents

### Currency Considerations
- Varies dramatically by topic
- Scientific consensus: More stable, older sources may still be valid
- Current events: Freshness critical
- Evergreen topics: Quality over recency

## Clarifying Questions (Examples)

When researching general topics, consider asking about:
- What aspect of the topic matters most
- Desired depth (overview vs. comprehensive)
- Any specific constraints or focus areas
- How the information will be used
- Time sensitivity of the information needed
